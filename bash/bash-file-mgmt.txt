# 1. Navigation and Viewing Files

    # Change Directory
        cd /path/to/directory                # Change to specific directory
        cd ~                                 # Go to home directory
        cd ..                                # Move up one directory level
        cd -                                 # Go to previous directory

    # List Files and Directories
        ls                                   # List files in the current directory
        ls -l                                # Long format (permissions, owner, size, etc.)
        ls -a                                # Include hidden files (starting with a dot)
        ls -lh                               # Human-readable sizes (KB, MB, etc.)
        ls -lt                               # Sort by modification time (newest first)

    # View File Contents
        cat filename                         # Output the contents of a file
        tac filename                         # Output the contents in reverse order
        less filename                        # View file with navigation (quicker for large files)
        more filename                        # Similar to less, but less advanced
        head filename                        # View the first 10 lines of a file
        head -n 20 filename                  # View the first 20 lines of a file
        tail filename                        # View the last 10 lines of a file
        tail -n 20 filename                  # View the last 20 lines of a file
        tail -f filename                     # Follow a file in real-time (e.g., log files)

    # View File Metadata
        stat filename                        # View detailed file metadata (size, permissions, etc.)
        file filename                        # Determine the file type (text, binary, etc.)

# 2. Creating and Managing Files

    #Create a New File
        touch filename                       # Create an empty file

    #Copy Files
        cp source_file /path/to/destination   # Copy a file to another location
        cp -r /source/directory /destination  # Copy a directory and its contents recursively
        cp -i source_file destination         # Prompt before overwriting files
        cp -v source_file destination         # Show verbose output (files being copied)

    # Move or Rename Files
        mv old_filename new_filename          # Rename a file
        mv /path/to/source /path/to/destination  # Move a file or directory

    # Delete Files
        rm filename                           # Delete a file
        rm -i filename                         # Prompt before deleting each file
        rm -f filename                         # Force delete a file (no prompt)
        rm -r directory/                       # Delete a directory and its contents recursively
        rm -rf directory/                      # Forcefully delete a directory and all contents

# 3. Creating and Managing Directories

    # Create Directories
        mkdir new_directory                   # Create a new directory
        mkdir -p /path/to/new_directory        # Create parent directories if they don't exist

    # Delete Directories
        rmdir empty_directory                  # Remove an empty directory
        rm -r directory/                       # Recursively delete a directory and its contents

# 4. Searching and Finding Files

    # Search for Files and Directories
        find /path -name filename              # Find files by name

        find /path -type f -name "*.txt"       # Find files with a specific extension
        find /path -size +100M                 # Find files larger than 100MB

    # Search for Text Inside Files
        grep 'search_term' filename            # Search for a specific text in a file
        grep -r 'search_term' /path            # Search recursively in a directory
        grep -i 'search_term' filename         # Case-insensitive search

        cmp file1 file2                       # Compare two files byte by byte

# Check File Type
    file filename                         # Determine the type of a file

# 15. File Permissions Overview

    # File permissions are set using three categories of users:
        # 1. Owner (u)
        # 2. Group (g)
        # 3. Others (o)

    # Permission types:
        # r: Read
        # w: Write
        # x: Execute

# Example of changing permissions
    chmod 755 filename                    # Owner can read/write/execute, others can read/execute
    chmod -R 644 /path                    # Apply read/write for owner, read-only for group and others
