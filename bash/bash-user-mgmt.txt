    # Create a New User
        sudo adduser username                          # Create a new user
        sudo useradd username                          # Create a user (basic)
        sudo passwd username                           # Set password for the user

    # Delete a User
        sudo deluser username                          # Delete a user (Ubuntu/Debian)
        sudo userdel username                          # Delete a user (CentOS/RHEL)
        sudo deluser --remove-home username            # Delete a user and their home directory
        sudo userdel -r username                       # Delete a user and their home directory

    # Modify User Information
        sudo usermod -c "Full Name" username           # Change user full name (comment)
        sudo usermod -l new_username old_username      # Rename a user
        sudo usermod -d /new/home/directory username   # Change home directory
        sudo usermod -s /bin/bash username             # Change default shell
        sudo usermod -aG groupname username            # Add user to an additional group

    # Create and Delete Groups
        sudo addgroup groupname                        # Create a new group (Ubuntu/Debian)
        sudo groupadd groupname                        # Create a new group (CentOS/RHEL)
        sudo delgroup groupname                        # Delete a group (Ubuntu/Debian)

        sudo usermod -aG groupname username            # Add user to a group
        sudo gpasswd -d username groupname             # Remove user from a group

    # List Groups for a User
        groups username                                # Show groups a user belongs to
        id username                                    # Display user ID, group ID, and groups

# 3. User and Group Information

    # View User Information
        id username                                    # Display user ID, group ID, and groups
        getent passwd username                         # Show user information from /etc/passwd
        finger username                                # Display user information (requires finger package)

        w                                              # Show logged-in users and what they are doing
        last                                           # Show last login history

# 4. File and Directory Permissions

    # View File Permissions
        ls -l                                          # List files with their permissions
        stat filename                                  # Detailed file permissions and ownership info

    # Change File/Directory Ownership
        sudo chown user:group filename                 # Change owner and group of a file
        sudo chown -R user:group /path/to/directory    # Recursively change owner and group

    # Change File/Directory Permissions
        chmod 644 filename                             # Set file permissions to -rw-r--r-- (owner read/write, group/others read-only)
        chmod 755 filename                             # Set file permissions to -rwxr-xr-x (owner all, group/others read/execute)
        chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory                # Recursively change permissions

    # Special Permissions (Setuid, Setgid, Sticky Bit)
        chmod u+s /path/to/file                        # Setuid: Executed file runs as file owner
        chmod g+s /path/to/directory                   # Setgid: Files in directory inherit group
        chmod +t /path/to/directory                    # Sticky bit: Only owner can delete files in directory

# 5. Sudo Privileges Management

    # Grant Sudo Privileges to a User
        sudo usermod -aG sudo username                 # Add user to the sudo group (Ubuntu/Debian)
        sudo usermod -aG wheel username                # Add user to the wheel group (CentOS/RHEL)

    # Edit Sudoers File
        sudo visudo                                    # Safely edit the sudoers file

    # Grant Specific Privileges to a User
        # Open sudoers file using visudo:
        sudo visudo

        # Example of granting user `username` permissions to restart networking without a password:
        username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service networking restart

    # Remove Sudo Privileges
        sudo deluser username sudo                     # Remove user from sudo group (Ubuntu/Debian)
        sudo gpasswd -d username wheel                 # Remove user from wheel group (CentOS/RHEL)

# 6. User Activity Monitoring

    # Check User Login History
        last                                           # Show login history
        lastlog                                        # Show the most recent login of all users

    # Monitor User Activity
        w                                              # Show who is logged in and their activities
        who                                            # Show who is logged in
        whoami                                         # Display the current logged-in user
        id                                             # Show the effective user and group IDs

    # Monitor User's Command History
        history                                        # Show command history of the current user
        cat ~/.bash_history                            # View specific user's bash history
        export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "                 # Show timestamp for each command in history

# 7. User and Group Quotas (Disk Usage Limits)

    # Install Quota Tools (Ubuntu/Debian)
        sudo apt install quota                         # Install quota package

    # Install Quota Tools (CentOS/RHEL)
        sudo yum install quota                         # Install quota package

    # Enable Disk Quotas on a Filesystem
        sudo mount -o remount,usrquota /               # Enable user quotas on root filesystem
        sudo mount -o remount,grpquota /               # Enable group quotas on root filesystem

    # Set Disk Quotas for a User
        sudo edquota -u username                       # Edit disk quota for a user

    # View User's Disk Quota Usage
        quota -u username                              # Check disk usage and limits for a user
        repquota /                                     # Report disk quota for the filesystem

# 8. User Account Security

    # Expire User Account
        sudo chage -E 0 username                       # Expire user account (disable immediately)
        sudo usermod -e YYYY-MM-DD username            # Set account expiration date

    # Lock/Unlock User Account
        sudo passwd -l username                        # Lock a user account
        sudo passwd -u username                        # Unlock a user account

    # Disable/Enable Shell Access
        sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin username     # Disable shell access for a user
        sudo usermod -s /bin/bash username             # Enable shell access for a user

    # Force User to Change Password on Next Login
        sudo passwd -e username                        # Expire password, force change at next login
        sudo chage -d 0 username                       # Same as above (reset password change date)

    # Set Password Expiration Policy
        sudo chage -M 90 username                      # Set password to expire in 90 days
        sudo chage -W 7 username                       # Warn user 7 days before password expiration
