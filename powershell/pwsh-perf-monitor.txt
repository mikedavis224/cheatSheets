# 4. CPU Management and Performance Tuning

    # Limit CPU Usage of a Process
        $process = Get-Process -Name "processname"
        $process.ProcessorAffinity = 0x0003                    # Limit process to specific CPU cores (bitmask)

    # Set Process Priority
        (Get-Process -Id 1234).PriorityClass = "High"          # Set high priority for a process

# 5. Memory Management and Tuning

    # Check Memory Usage
        Get-Counter '\Memory\Available MBytes'                 # Check available memory
        Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object FreePhysicalMemory,TotalVisibleMemorySize

    # Clear Standby Memory
        Clear-MemoryCache                                      # Clear the standby list (requires PowerShell module)

# 6. I/O Performance Management

    # Check Disk I/O
        Get-Counter '\PhysicalDisk(*)\Disk Transfers/sec'      # Check I/O operations per second

    # Monitor Disk Latency
